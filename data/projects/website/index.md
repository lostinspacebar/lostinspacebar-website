LOST.IN.SPACEBAR is my personal portfolio, made using React and Node.js.
The main goals of this website are to show off and provide updates on any projects I'm working on. In addition, this provides me with a way to keep myself on track and to stay motivated.
The website is made in React (started out as a simple create-react-app) and is hosted on a Node.js server using express for routing.
